WAVV — PROMPT COMMANDS REFERENCE

These are control phrases you can use while working with Wavv Founder Mode.

========================================
MODE & VERBOSITY
========================================

"Mode 1" or "Return to Strategic Default Mode."
- Puts the model into architecture-first mode.
- You get: system-level reasoning first, then code.
- Use this when work is complex, risky, or cross-cutting.

"Mode 3" or "Switch to Hybrid Mode."
- Puts the model into concise, code-first mode.
- You get: shorter reasoning, faster iterations, still safe.
- Use this when we’re in a tight implementation loop.

========================================
CHECKPOINT / FILE COMPLETION
========================================

"Step Completed."
- Forces a CHECKPOINT BUNDLE.
- The model must summarize:
  - current goal
  - step finished
  - files touched
  - routes/APIs
  - env vars
  - assumptions
  - next step
  - TikTok/Supabase/Auth status
- Use this after finishing a meaningful build step.

"File Done For Now."
- Signals that work on the current file is complete for this step.
- Triggers a file-focused checkpoint and ACTIVE FILES update.
- Use this after you paste a file back in and we agree it’s good.

========================================
BOOT PROMPT & DRIFT MANAGEMENT
========================================

"Update the Boot Prompt."
- Use when you agree that a new rule or behavior should become permanent.
- The model must:
  - regenerate the full Boot Prompt with changes merged,
  - update version number,
  - also emit an updated runtime snapshot in the same answer.

"Auto-Approve Prompt Updates Until I Say Stop."
- Turns on auto-approval for Boot Prompt updates.
- When a protocol/architecture/permanent rule is added:
  - the model updates the Boot Prompt immediately without asking.
- Use this only when you want maximum momentum and trust the changes.

"Stop auto-approving."
- Turns OFF auto-approval.
- After this, the model must ask for confirmation before modifying the Boot Prompt again.

========================================
RUNTIME SNAPSHOT CONTROL
========================================

"Give me the current Runtime Snapshot."
- The model must output:
  - CURRENT THREAD
  - ACTIVE FILES
  - CHECKPOINT
  - DIRECTION LOG
- Use this to copy into prompt/RUNTIME_SNAPSHOT.txt after a checkpoint.

"Rebuild state from this snapshot."
- Use when you paste a snapshot at the start of a new chat.
- Tells the model explicitly: use this snapshot as ground truth for where we left off.

========================================
CODE / ARCHITECTURE BEHAVIOR
========================================

"Full file only."
- Reminds the model to output entire files, not diffs.
- Use when you want copy-paste simplicity.

"Diff is okay here."
- Grants permission (for this instance) to give a minimal change / patch instead of whole file.
- Use when the file is huge and you’re comfortable editing manually.

"Keep this file under control."
- Softly reinforces the file-size governance rule for the currently discussed file.
- The model should:
  - avoid bloating the file,
  - propose splitting into subcomponents/helpers if it’s getting large.

========================================
RECOVERY / RESET FLOWS
========================================

"New chat, same project."
- Use at the top of a brand new chat.
- Flow:
  - Paste Boot Prompt.
  - Paste RUNTIME_SNAPSHOT.txt.
  - Then say "New chat, same project." with a short instruction.
- Signals that we’re resuming work, not starting fresh.

"State Refresh Ritual."
- Ask the model to re-summarize:
  - current architecture assumptions,
  - active thread,
  - key tables and flows involved in the current work.
- Use this if things feel fuzzy or drifted but you’re still in the same chat.

========================================
TESTING & ENVIRONMENT
========================================

"Give me the test plan for this change."
- The model must:
  - list URLs to visit,
  - actions to take,
  - expected outcomes,
  - key failure points to watch for.

"Clarify where each command runs."
- The model must explicitly label commands by location:
  - local terminal,
  - Supabase SQL editor,
  - Vercel dashboard,
  - TikTok Developer Portal, etc.

========================================
GENERAL SAFETY
========================================

If you ever feel lost, you can say:

"Pause and reorient."
- The model must:
  - restate the current thread,
  - summarize what we’re doing and why,
  - list the next 1–3 actions only.

This file is just a reference. Updating it is optional, but you can expand it as new control phrases emerge.
